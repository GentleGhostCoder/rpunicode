Description: Provides a fast and correct implementation of the Punycode algorithm. Punycode is a standard for converting Unicode strings to ASCII without loss of information. This is useful for internationalized domain names (IDNs) and other situations where strings are used in environments that do not support Unicode. The package is based on the C/C++ library 'ICU - International Components for Unicode' and is licensed under the MIT license.
